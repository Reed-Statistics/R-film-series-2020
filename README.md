Please join Tuesday from 12 - 1 pm this spring for screenings of excellent talks from the recent [Rstudio::conf](https://rstudio.com/conference/). We'll be meeting in **Physics 123**. Many/most of these talks have useful gems even to folks with only limited exposure to programming and R.

Come for the talks, stay for the follow-up conversation (and free pizza)!
